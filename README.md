# 📘 Class GitHub Repository – Contribution & Submission Guide

Welcome! This repository is used for class assignments, exercises, and projects. To keep everything organized and fair, **everyone must follow the rules below exactly** when contributing.

Please read this carefully before submitting any work.

---

## ✅ General Rules

- Every student must work **only inside their own folder**
- Folder names and commit messages must follow the exact format described below
- Do **not** edit, delete, or move another student’s work
- Do **not** push directly to the `main` branch unless instructed

Failure to follow these rules may result in your work not being graded.

## 📁 Folder Structure (Very Important)

Each student must have **one folder** named after their **full name** using these rules:

- ✅ All lowercase letters
- ✅ No spaces
- ✅ No special characters

### 🔹 Folder name format

```
fullname
```

### 🔹 Example

If your full name is:

> Marcus Oware

Your folder **must** be:

```
marcusoware/
```

All your assignments, files, and projects must stay inside **your own folder only**.

❌ Wrong examples:
```
MarcusOware/
marcus_oware/
marcus oware/
```
